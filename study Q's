1.  Actions is a way for a user to interact with the website. Actions also control
    what events happen at what time. Reducers is the place where action will change
    the state, api information, or any data that is sent through it abd publish it
    to the store. The store is a library that stores and (can) display
    all of the current and previous information.


2.  Application state has one store that is accessible to any component that is linked
    to io. Component state has multiple instances of different components and can be
    overwelming with the amount of props being passed.

3.  To explain it in its simplest form, its a function in a function. I will act as
    function to connect the middleware to the reducer.
